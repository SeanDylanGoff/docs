While all out-of-the-box system fields are locked from editing or deleting, you are able to create new fields within the
system collections. To get started, expand System Collections from the bottom of **Settings > Data Model**.

### Sort Fields

The sort feature enables manual drag-and-drop Item reordering within the Directus App. This is typically shown on the
[Collection Page](/app/content-collections/), but can also be used for sorting items within
[Junction Tables](/getting-started/glossary/#junction-collections). Configuration is as easy as selecting the
appropriate sort field:

- **Sort Field** — Choose a field with the `integer` type. You may want to set this field to be "hidden" so it doesn't
  show up within the Item Page form.

::: tip Automatic Setup

When creating a new Collection, you have the option of creating an optional "Sort" field. If you choose to include this
field, the collection's sort settings will automatically be configured for you.

Field** on the field's Relationship pane.
